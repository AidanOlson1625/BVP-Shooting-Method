# BVP-Shooting-Method
In this project by Aidan Olson, Luke Gulson, and Dylan Teima, we used the BVP shooting method to solve the second order nonlinear spring mass system ordinary differential equation (ODE). The files in this repository include a pdf of our final report, a MATLAB file where we stored all of our code, and this README.

# Abstract

Shooting methods are used to solve differential equations numerically. They involve starting with an initial guess for the solution and then iter- atively updating the guess by ”shooting” from one point on the equation towards another point until a root (i.e., a solution) is found. In other words, they’re like aiming a gun at two points on an equation and calculating how far off course you need to go based on the intersection of those lines in order to hit your target. Different types of shooting methods can have different advantages depending on the properties of the differential equation being solved. For example, some may converge faster than others, while others might require fewer iterations to reach convergence. These methods are widely used in many fields such as engineering, physics, finance, and more generally in any field involving complex mathematical models that can be formulated as systems of ODEs.
